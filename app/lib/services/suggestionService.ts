Given the database schema below, generate 12 different types of suggestions that would be valuable and interesting to build. Consider:

1. **Web Applications**: Customer portals, admin panels, e-commerce platforms, content management systems
2. **Data Dashboards**: Business intelligence dashboards, analytics visualizations, KPI monitoring
3. **Business Applications**: CRM systems, inventory management, project tracking, HR systems
4. **Analytics Platforms**: Reporting tools, data warehouses, business intelligence suites

Each suggestion should be:
- Specific to the data available in the schema
- Clear and actionable (e.g., "build a customer portal for order management")
- Focused on solving real business problems or creating value
- Concise but descriptive enough to understand the goal
- Diverse in scope (mix of different types of applications)
- Start with an action, followed by a subject (e.g. "create a revenue analytics app", "build an organization activity monitoring dashboard")

Database Schema:
${formattedSchema}

Generate exactly 12 suggestions that would be most valuable for this database. Make sure to vary the types of applications (e.g., don't suggest all dashboards). Output your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "suggestions": [
    "suggestion 1",
    "suggestion 2",
    "suggestion 3",
    "suggestion 4",
    "suggestion 5",
    "suggestion 6",
    "suggestion 7",
    "suggestion 8",
    "suggestion 9",
    "suggestion 10",
    "suggestion 11",
    "suggestion 12"
  ]
}

Make sure that the suggestions are not too long, at most 6-7 words.
