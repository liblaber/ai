## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your data stays yours.** We've designed liblab.ai with security and privacy as core principles.

### How Your Database Connection Works

When you connect your database to liblab.ai, here's exactly what happens:

1. **🏠 Local Connection**: Your database credentials are stored locally on your machine and never sent to external servers
2. **🔧 App Generation**: When you build an app, it runs in a secure web container that displays live dashboards with your data
3. **🌐 Secure Tunneling**: Since the web container can't directly access your local database, we use ngrok to create a secure tunnel
4. **🔐 End-to-End Encryption**: Every database request, response, query, and data output is encrypted using AES-256 encryption

### Your Encryption Key

- **🔑 Locally Generated**: A unique encryption key is generated on your machine during setup
- **🔒 Never Shared**: This key stays on your local machine and is never transmitted anywhere
- **🎯 User-Specific**: Each user gets their own unique encryption key
- **💾 Secure Storage**: Keys are stored securely in your local environment

### Data Flow Security

```
Your Database → Encrypted Request → Secure Tunnel → Web Container
     ↑                                                    ↓
Local Machine ← Encrypted Response ← Secure Tunnel ← Preview Dashboard
```

**What this means for you:**

- ✅ Database credentials never leave your machine
- ✅ All data transmission is encrypted with your unique key
- ✅ Even if network traffic is intercepted, data remains unreadable
- ✅ No data is stored on external servers
- ✅ You maintain complete control over your data access

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) - Package manager
- [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/signup) - Free account for local tunneling (one time setup)
  - create an account with ngrok
  - run `brew install ngrok`
  - run `ngrok config add-authtoken <your-ngrok-auth-token>`
- [Anthropic's API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/overview) - API key to access LLM models

### Setup

Run the setup:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

If you lack permissions to run `scripts/setup.sh` fix it with:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
```

**That's it! 🎉**

The script automatically handles:

- Setup ngrok tunnel (macOS/Linux)
- Configure `.env` file
- Install all dependencies
- Setup SQLite database

### Start the app

Start the development server with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### LLM Configuration

> **💡 Recommended Providers**  
> For optimal performance with liblab.ai, we recommend:
>
> - **Anthropic Claude-3 Sonnet** (Default) - Best overall performance with excellent code understanding and large context handling
> - **Google Gemini Pro** - Strong alternative with robust code generation capabilities
>
> These providers consistently deliver the best results for our use cases, handling large system prompts, code modifications, and complex app generation tasks.

By default, liblab.ai uses Anthropic's Claude (claude-3-5-sonnet-latest). Configure your preferred provider:

```bash
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=<provider_name>  # Default: 'Anthropic'
DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL=<model_name>        # Default: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest'
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy Generated Apps to Netlify

You can deploy your generated apps directly to Netlify. To enable this:

1. Create a [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
2. Generate an auth token from User Settings > Applications > New access token
3. Add the token to your `.env` file:
   ```
   NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

Once configured, you can deploy any app you generate through liblab.ai to Netlify using the deploy option in the UI.
