## **üöÄ Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Deploy with Docker (Recommended) ‚≠ê**

**Prerequisites**

<details>
  <summary><b>Node.js</b> <em>(Only required for configuration, not for running the app)</em></summary>

Node.js is a program that helps your computer run certain types of applications. You'll need it to set up this project, but don't worry - it's free and easy to install!

<strong>üì± macOS (Mac computers)</strong>

**Option 1: Simple download (Recommended for beginners)**

1. Open your web browser and go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. You'll see two download buttons - click the one that says "LTS" (it's the safer, more stable version)
3. The file will download automatically
4. Double-click the downloaded file (it will end in .pkg)
5. Follow the installation wizard - just click "Continue" and "Install" when prompted
6. Enter your computer password when asked

**Option 2: Using Homebrew**

1. Open Terminal
2. Copy and paste this command: `brew install node`
3. Press Enter and wait for it to finish

<strong>ü™ü Windows</strong>

**Option 1: Simple download (Recommended for beginners)**

1. Open your web browser and go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. You'll see two download buttons - click the one that says "LTS" (it's the safer, more stable version)
3. The file will download automatically
4. Find the downloaded file (usually in your Downloads folder) and double-click it
5. Follow the installation wizard - just click "Next" and "Install" when prompted
6. Click "Finish" when done

<strong>üêß Linux</strong>

**Ubuntu/Debian (most common Linux versions)**

1. Open Terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T)
2. Copy and paste this command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm`
3. Press Enter and type your password when asked
4. Type "Y" and press Enter to confirm

**Other Linux versions**

1. Open Terminal
2. Copy and paste this command: `sudo snap install node --classic`
3. Press Enter and type your password when asked

<strong>‚úÖ How to check if it worked</strong>

After installation, you can verify it worked:

1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
2. Type: `node --version` and press Enter
3. You should see something like "v22.0.0" or higher
4. Type: `npm --version` and press Enter
5. You should see a version number like "9.6.7"

<strong>‚ùì Need help?</strong>

- **Windows users:** If you get an error about "node is not recognized", restart your computer after installation or refer to the [official Windows guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
- **Mac users:** If you get a security warning, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click "Allow"
- **Linux users:** If you get a permission error, make sure to type `sudo` before the commands

  <summary><b>Anthropic API Key </b><em>(Required for AI model access)</em></summary>

<strong>Step 1: Create an Anthropic Account</strong>

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com/signup](https://console.anthropic.com/signup)
2. Create an account
3. Verify your email

<strong>Step 2: Generate an API Key</strong> 4. Go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) 5. Click "Create Key" 6. Give it a name (e.g., "liblab-ai") 7. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

<strong>Step 3: Save your API Key</strong>
Add this to your `.env` file during setup, but keep it handy:

```bash

<strong>Step 1: Create a Netlify account</strong>

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account

<strong>Step 2: Generate an auth token</strong> 3. Go to User Settings &gt; Applications &gt; New access token 4. Generate and copy your token

<strong>Step 3: Add the token to your .env file</strong>

```

Once configured, you can deploy any app you generate through liblab.ai to Netlify using the deploy option in the UI.

</details>

[liblab.ai](http://liblab.ai/) runs best on Chrome or Chromium browsers when using a desktop. Mobile browsers don't have full support right now.

Some browser add-ons like ad blockers or VPNs might cause problems. If things aren't working right, try disabling them and reload the page.

**Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liblaber/ai.git
cd ai
```

**Run the setup**

```bash
pnpm run quickstart
```

**That's it! üéâ** The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### **Quickstart Behavior**

The `pnpm run quickstart` command now **always pulls the latest code and Docker images** to ensure you're running the most up-to-date version. Here's what happens:

- ‚úÖ **Always rebuilds** Docker images with latest code
- ‚úÖ **Preserves your database** by default (keeps existing data)
- ‚úÖ **Interactive prompts** if you have existing data
- ‚úÖ **Migration support** for database schema changes

**Additional quickstart options:**

```bash
# Standard quickstart (preserves database)
pnpm run quickstart

# Fresh start (removes all existing data)
pnpm run quickstart:fresh

# Explicitly preserve database
pnpm run quickstart:preserve
```

**Database Migration**

If you encounter database issues after updating, use the migration tool:

```bash
pnpm run docker:migrate
```

This provides options to:

- Auto-migrate database schema
- Create backups before migrating
- Reset database (‚ö†Ô∏è **loses all data**)

### How Quickstart Handles Your Data

**Your data is PRESERVED when:**

- You run `pnpm run quickstart:preserve`
- You run the standard `pnpm run quickstart` and choose to preserve data when prompted (this is the default)

**Your data is REMOVED (fresh start) when:**

- You run `pnpm run quickstart:fresh`
- You run the standard `pnpm run quickstart` and choose to reset the database when prompted
- No existing data is found (e.g., on first-time setup)

**Important Notes:**

- üîÑ **Code is always updated** - Docker images are rebuilt with latest code
- üíæ **Database behavior is configurable** - You control whether to keep or reset data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Schema changes may require migration** - Use `pnpm run docker:migrate` if needed

### **Option 2: Manual Installation**

**For developers who prefer full control over their environment or need to run without Docker.**

> üí° Note:¬†We recommend using Docker (Option 1) for the best experience, as it handles all dependencies and provides a consistent environment.
