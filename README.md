## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your data stays yours.** We've designed liblab.ai with security and privacy as core principles.

### How Your Database Connection Works

When you connect your database to liblab.ai, here's exactly what happens:

1. **🏠 Local Connection**: Your database credentials are stored locally on your machine and never sent to external servers
2. **🔧 App Generation**: When you build an app, it runs in a secure web container that displays live dashboards with your data
3. **🌐 Secure Tunneling**: Since the web container can't directly access your local database, we use ngrok to create a secure tunnel
4. **🔐 End-to-End Encryption**: Every database request, response, query, and data output is encrypted using AES-256 encryption

### Your Encryption Key

- **🔑 Locally Generated**: A unique encryption key is generated on your machine during setup
- **🔒 Never Shared**: This key stays on your local machine and is never transmitted anywhere
- **🎯 User-Specific**: Each user gets their own unique encryption key
- **💾 Secure Storage**: Keys are stored securely in your local environment

### Data Flow Security

```
Your Database → Encrypted Request → Secure Tunnel → Web Container
     ↑                                                    ↓
Local Machine ← Encrypted Response ← Secure Tunnel ← Preview Dashboard
```

**What this means for you:**

- ✅ Database credentials never leave your machine
- ✅ All data transmission is encrypted with your unique key
- ✅ Even if network traffic is intercepted, data remains unreadable
- ✅ No data is stored on external servers
- ✅ You maintain complete control over your data access

---

## 📈 Telemetry

To help us improve liblab AI, we collect anonymous usage data to help make liblab AI better for everyone. This includes:

- Error reports to identify bugs and improve stability
- Usage patterns to understand how features are used
- Performance metrics to optimize speed and responsiveness
- Prompts sent to the LLM to enhance the quality of generated outputs and improve prompt understanding

**We do not collect any personal information, built app code, user data, or chat responses from the LLM, only the prompts you send. All data is anonymized and used solely to improve the product.**

Events are sent to [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) for analytics. This helps us understand how the open source project is used and where users encounter issues, so we can improve the experience.

### How to Disable Telemetry

Telemetry is enabled by default. To disable it, set the following in your `.env` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

If you do not provide a `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` in your `.env`, telemetry will also be disabled automatically.

#### Setup

First, run the setup script to configure your environment:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

#### Start with Docker

After setup is complete, start the app with Docker:

```bash
pnpm run docker:start
```

**That's it! 🎉** The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

For the fastest setup experience, use our quickstart command:

```bash
pnpm run quickstart
```

This single command will:

- Install all dependencies
- Generate Prisma client
- Run the setup script
- Start the production Docker environment

#### Docker Commands

**Production Environment:**

```bash
# Start production environment
pnpm run docker:start

# Rebuild and start production environment
pnpm run docker:rebuild

# Stop all Docker services
pnpm run docker:stop
```

**Development Environment:**

```bash
# Start development environment (app + database in containers)
pnpm run docker:dev

# Stop all Docker services
pnpm run docker:stop
```

**Database Management:**

```bash
# Start database only (for local development)
pnpm run db:start

# Stop database
pnpm run db:stop

# Restart database
pnpm run db:restart
```

#### Database Setup

**Initial Database Setup**

Run the database setup script to initialize the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
tsx ./scripts/docker-db-setup.ts
```

This script will:

- Start the PostgreSQL container
- Run database migrations
- Generate the Prisma client
- Seed the database (if seed script exists)

**Database Connection Details**

- **Host:** localhost
- **Port:** 5432
- **Database:** liblab
- **Username:** liblab
- **Password:** liblab_password
- **Connection URL:** `postgresql://liblab:liblab_password@localhost:5432/liblab`

**Database Persistence**

The PostgreSQL data is persisted in a Docker volume named `liblab_postgres_data`. This ensures that:

- Database changes survive container restarts
- Data is not lost when containers are recreated
- Multiple developers can use the same database setup

#### Docker Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://liblab:liblab_password@localhost:5432/liblab"
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Docker Database Operations

```bash
# Run migrations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ai-app-dev pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# Generate Prisma client
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ai-app-dev pnpm prisma generate

# Open Prisma Studio
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ai-app-dev pnpm prisma studio

# Reset database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec ai-app-dev pnpm prisma migrate reset
```

#### Docker Container Management

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Remove volumes (⚠️ This will delete all data)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
```

#### Docker Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues**

1. **Check if PostgreSQL is running:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps
   ```

2. **Check database logs:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs postgres
   ```

3. **Reset the database:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
   tsx ./scripts/docker-db-setup.ts
   ```

**Volume Issues**

If you need to reset the database volume:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Remove the volume
docker volume rm liblab_postgres_data

# Restart and setup
tsx ./scripts/docker-db-setup.ts
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation

**For developers who prefer full control over their environment or need to run without Docker.**

> **💡 Note:** We recommend using Docker (Option 1) for the best experience, as it handles all dependencies and provides a consistent environment.

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have all the following installed and configured:

<details>
<summary><strong>Node.js (18 or higher)</strong> - Required for running the application</summary>

#### Option A: Single version of Node, using Homebrew (Recommended for most users)

**Best for:** Simple setup, single Node.js version, macOS users

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js
brew install node
```

#### Option B: Using Node Version Manager (Recommended for developers)

**Best for:** Developers who work with multiple projects requiring switching different Node.js versions

```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install NVM
brew install nvm

# To make the nvm command available, restart your terminal or run:
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc

# Install latest stable Node.js
nvm install --lts
```

#### Verify Installation

```bash
node --version  # Should show v18.x.x or higher
npm --version   # Should show version number
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> pnpm</strong> - Package manager (faster than npm)</summary>

```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm

# Verify installation
pnpm --version
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ngrok</strong> - Local tunneling for development (automatic setup)</summary>

#### Step 1: Install Ngrok

Ngrok is automatically installed as a dependency when you run the setup script. No manual configuration required!

If you need to install it manually:

```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

#### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
ngrok --version
```

> **💡 Note:** The setup script handles ngrok installation automatically, so you don't need to do anything manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Anthropic API Key</strong> - Required for AI model access</summary>

#### Step 1: Create Anthropic Account

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com/signup](https://console.anthropic.com/signup)
2. Create an account
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Generate API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "liblab-ai")
4. Copy the API key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

#### Step 3: Save Your API Key

You'll add this to your `.env` file during setup, but keep it handy:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
```

> **💡 Pro Tip:** The setup script will prompt you for this API key, so you don't need to manually edit files.

</details>

#### Setup

Run the setup:

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

**That's it! 🎉**

The script automatically handles:

- Setup ngrok tunnel (macOS/Linux)
- Configure `.env` file
- Install all dependencies

#### Start the app

Start the development server with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> **💡 Note:** The `dev` command now automatically starts the PostgreSQL database in Docker and runs the Next.js development server locally.

### Development with PostgreSQL Database

For development with a PostgreSQL database running in Docker, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Start Database and App Together (Recommended)

The default `dev` command now automatically starts the PostgreSQL database in Docker and runs the Next.js development server locally:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This is the easiest way to get started with a PostgreSQL database for development.

#### Option 2: Manage Database Separately

You can also manage the database independently:

```bash
# Start only the PostgreSQL database
pnpm run db:start

# Stop the database
pnpm run db:stop

# Restart the database
pnpm run db:restart

```

Then run your app normally with `pnpm run dev` (make sure your `.env` has the correct `DATABASE_URL`).

**Alternative Development Commands:**

- `pnpm run dockerdev` - Used internally inside the Docker container to start the app in development mode
- `pnpm run docker:dev` - Run both app and database in Docker containers

#### Shared Database Data

All three Docker Compose configurations share the same database data:

- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Production setup with full app and database
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml`** - Development setup with app and database in containers
- **`docker-compose.db.yml`** - Database-only setup for local development

This means you can:

- Start the database with `pnpm run dev:with-db` (uses `docker-compose.db.yml`)
- Switch to full Docker development with `pnpm run docker:dev` (uses `docker-compose.dev.yml`)
- Deploy with `pnpm run docker:start` (uses `docker-compose.yml`)

All configurations will use the same PostgreSQL data volume, so your data persists across different setups.

#### Database Configuration

The PostgreSQL database runs with these default settings:

- **Host**: `localhost:5432`
- **Database**: `liblab`
- **Username**: `liblab`
- **Password**: `liblab_password`
- **Connection URL**: `postgresql://liblab:liblab_password@localhost:5432/liblab`

Make sure your `.env` file includes:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://liblab:liblab_password@localhost:5432/liblab
```

### LLM Configuration

> **💡 Recommended Providers**  
> For optimal performance with liblab.ai, we recommend:
>
> - **Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet** (Default) - Best overall performance with excellent code understanding and large context handling
> - **Google Gemini Pro** - Strong alternative with robust code generation capabilities
>
> These providers consistently deliver the best results for our use cases, handling large system prompts, code modifications, and complex app generation tasks.

## 🎬 Starter Template

liblab.ai supports multiple starter templates for generating apps. You can control which starter is used by setting the `STARTER` environment variable in your `.env` file or at runtime.

### How to Set the Starter

Add the following to your `.env` file (or set as an environment variable):

```
# Name of the starter project
STARTER=
```

- Supported values: `next`, `remix`
- If not set, the default is `next`.

### How Starters Work

Each starter lives in its own directory under [`starters/`](starters/). For example, the default Next.js starter is in [`starters/next-starter/`](starters/next-starter/).

Each starter must include a `.liblab` directory with the following files:

- [`prompt`](starters/next-starter/.liblab/prompt): The main system prompt and instructions for code generation
- [`technologies`](starters/next-starter/.liblab/technologies): List of technologies used by the starter (one per line)
- [`examples`](starters/next-starter/.liblab/examples): Example user prompts and responses for this starter
- [`ignore`](starters/next-starter/.liblab/ignore): Patterns for files/folders to exclude from importing into the builder.

These files are dynamically imported and used in the [`getAppsPrompt`](app/lib/common/prompts/apps.ts) logic to generate apps and instructions.

### Adding a New Starter

1. Create a new directory under [`starters/`](starters/) named `<your-starter>-starter` (e.g., `my-starter-starter`).
2. Add a `.liblab` directory inside your starter with the files that will improve the quality of generated code: `prompt`, `technologies`, `examples` and `ignore`.
3. Update the plugin types in [`app/lib/plugins/types.ts`](app/lib/plugins/types.ts) to include your new starter in `StarterPluginId` and `PluginAccessMap`.
4. Set `STARTER=<your-starter>` in your `.env` file to use your new starter.

> **Tip:** See the [default Next.js starter prompt](starters/next-starter/.liblab/prompt) for a comprehensive example of how to structure your starter's instructions.

---

## 🔧 Custom User Management

liblab.ai supports custom user management implementations through a plugin system. You can override the default single-user behavior with your own multi-user or custom organization management logic.

### How to Create a Custom Implementation

1. Create a file at `app/lib/plugins/user-management/custom-user-management.ts`
2. Export a class that implements the `UserManagementPlugin` interface:

```typescript
import type { UserManagementPlugin } from './user-management-plugin-manager';

export default class CustomUserManagement implements UserManagementPlugin {
  async createOrganizationFromEmail(email: string, userId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Your custom logic here
    // Example: Create multi-user organizations, domain-based grouping, etc.
    // You can use the provided userService and organizationService to access database resources.
  }
}
```

**Note:** You can use the provided `userService` and `organizationService` classes to access and manage users and organizations in the database.

### Built-in Implementations

liblab.ai includes two built-in user management implementations:

- **Single-User Management**: Default implementation for single-user + single-organization setups
- **Multi-User Management**: Supports multiple users per organization with domain-based grouping

### Use Cases

- **Multi-User Organizations**: Support teams with multiple members and roles
- **Domain-Based Grouping**: Automatically group users by email domain (e.g., company.com users join same org)
- **Advanced Permissions**: Implement custom role-based access control
- **Organization Management**: Custom logic for creating, managing, and organizing user groups

## 📦 Shared Code and Data Accessors

### Adding Shared Code

The `@shared` directory contains reusable code that can be used across different parts of the application. When adding shared code:

1. Place your code in the appropriate subdirectory under `shared/src/`
2. Keep shared code independent of the main project's dependencies
3. Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
4. Include proper documentation and type definitions
5. Write unit tests for shared functionality

Example structure:

```
shared/
  src/
    types/         # TypeScript type definitions
    utils/         # Utility functions
    constants/     # Shared constants
    data-access/   # Database accessors
```

### Creating Data Accessors

Data accessors provide a standardized way to interact with different database types. To add a new data accessor:

1. Create a new file in `shared/src/data-access/accessors/` (e.g., `mysql.ts`)
2. Implement the `BaseAccessor` interface by creating a class that implements it:

   ```typescript
   import type { BaseAccessor } from '../baseAccessor';
   import type { MySqlColumn, MySqlTable } from '../../types';
   import type { Connection } from 'mysql2/promise';
   import mysql from 'mysql2/promise';

   // Configure type casting for numeric values
   const typesToParse = ['INT', 'BIGINT', 'DECIMAL', 'NUMERIC', 'FLOAT', 'DOUBLE', 'NEWDECIMAL'];

   export class MySQLAccessor implements BaseAccessor {
     readonly label = 'MySQL';
     private _connection: Connection | null = null;

     static isAccessor(databaseUrl: string): boolean {
       return databaseUrl.startsWith('mysql://');
     }

     async testConnection(databaseUrl: string): Promise<boolean> {
       try {
         const connection = await mysql.createConnection(databaseUrl);
         await connection.query('SELECT 1');
         await connection.end();
         return true;
       } catch (error: any) {
         return false;
       }
     }

     async executeQuery(query: string, params?: string[]): Promise<any[]> {
       if (!this._connection) {
         throw new Error('Database connection not initialized. Please call initialize() first.');
       }

       try {
         const [rows] = await this._connection.query(query, params);
         return rows as any[];
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Error executing query:', JSON.stringify(error));
         throw new Error((error as Error)?.message);
       }
     }

     guardAgainstMaliciousQuery(query: string): void {
       if (!query) {
         throw new Error('No SQL query provided. Please provide a valid SQL query to execute.');
       }

       const normalizedQuery = query.trim().toUpperCase();

       if (!normalizedQuery.startsWith('SELECT') && !normalizedQuery.startsWith('WITH')) {
         throw new Error('SQL query must start with SELECT or WITH');
       }

       const forbiddenKeywords = [
         'INSERT ',
         'UPDATE ',
         'DELETE ',
         'DROP ',
         'TRUNCATE ',
         'ALTER ',
         'CREATE ',
         'GRANT ',
         'REVOKE ',
       ];

       if (forbiddenKeywords.some((keyword) => normalizedQuery.includes(keyword))) {
         throw new Error('SQL query contains forbidden keywords');
       }
     }

     async getSchema(): Promise<MySqlTable[]> {
       if (!this._connection) {
         throw new Error('Database connection not initialized. Please call initialize() first.');
       }

       // Query to get all tables with their comments
       const tablesQuery = `
         SELECT
           TABLE_NAME,
           TABLE_COMMENT
         FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
         WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = DATABASE()
         AND TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'
         ORDER BY TABLE_NAME;
       `;

       // Query to get all columns with their details
       const columnsQuery = `
         SELECT
           c.TABLE_NAME,

3. Register your accessor in `dataAccessor.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import type { BaseAccessor, BaseAccessorConstructor } from './baseAccessor';
   import { PostgresAccessor } from './accessors/postgres';
   import { MySQLAccessor } from './accessors/mysql';

   export class DataAccessor {
     static getAccessor(databaseUrl: string): BaseAccessor {
       const allAccessors: BaseAccessorConstructor[] = [PostgresAccessor, MySQLAccessor];

       const AccessorClass = allAccessors.find((Acc) => Acc.isAccessor(databaseUrl));

       if (!AccessorClass) {
         throw new Error(`No accessor found for database URL: ${databaseUrl}`);
       }

       return new AccessorClass();
     }
   }
   ```

Each accessor should:

- Handle database-specific connection logic
- Implement security measures (e.g., query validation)
- Provide schema information
- Support parameterized queries
- Handle errors appropriately
- Implement connection testing
- Properly manage database connections (initialize/close)
- Support type casting for numeric values
- Handle enum types and their values
- Include table and column comments in schema information

The accessor interface ensures consistent behavior across different database types while allowing for database-specific optimizations and features.
