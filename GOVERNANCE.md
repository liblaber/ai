# Governance Model

## Overview

liblab.ai follows a **Modified Open Governance** model that balances community input with efficient decision-making. Our governance structure is designed to support the rapid development of AI-powered developer tools while maintaining transparency and community engagement.

## Decision-Making Process

### Technical Decisions

- **Core Maintainers** make technical decisions including architecture, dependencies, and implementation approaches
- **Community input** is gathered through GitHub Issues for major technical changes
- **RFC Process** for significant changes that affect the user experience or API

### Strategic Decisions

- **Project Leadership Team** makes decisions about roadmap, partnerships, and major feature priorities
- **Community feedback** is actively sought through GitHub Issues and user research

### Administrative Decisions

- **Liblab, Inc.** maintains control over branding, legal matters, and infrastructure
- **Community Manager** handles day-to-day community operations

## Roles and Responsibilities

## RFC (Request for Comments) Process

For significant changes that affect users or the overall architecture:
