# Governance

liblab.ai follows a Modified Open Governance model balancing community input with efficient decision-making.

## Decision-Making

- Technical: Core maintainers decide architecture, dependencies, implementations; community input via issues; RFCs for significant changes
- Strategic: Project leadership team sets roadmap and priorities with community feedback
- Administrative: Liblab, Inc. manages branding, legal, and infrastructure

## Roles

- Project Leadership Team: Vision, major decisions, resources
- Core Maintainers: Review/merge PRs, triage issues, mentor contributors, maintain quality
- Contributors: Submit PRs, report issues, improve docs

## Processes

- Standard changes: PR → review → merge (one maintainer approval)
- Significant changes: Discussion → RFC (if needed) → implementation → review (two approvals)
- Major changes: RFC → community feedback → leadership approval → implementation
- Emergency changes: Immediate fix with post-review

## RFC Process

1. Create RFC issue
2. Community discussion (≥1 week)
3. Core maintainer review
4. Final comment period (72 hours)
5. Decision by leadership team
6. Implementation via PRs

## Communication

- Issues: Bug reports, feature requests, and discussions
- Pull requests: Code review and implementation
- Email: community@liblab.ai

This document will evolve as the project grows.
