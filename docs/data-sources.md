## What Are Data Sources?

Data sources are where your information lives - databases, spreadsheets, or cloud services. Connect yours and start building applications with natural language.
liblab.ai supports having multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) for each data source, allowing you to switch between them seamlessly.

## Step-By-Step Data Source Management

Managing data sources in **liblab.ai** is straightforward and flexible, allowing you to connect, configure, and switch between multiple environments with ease.

#### 1. Adding your first data source

When the app is opened for the first time, you‚Äôll see a screen prompting you to connect your first data source.  
Choose a **data source type** and an **environment**, then provide the required properties (e.g., connection URL for databases, access token for HubSpot, etc.).

#### 2. Adding a new data source in the control panel

You can add as many data sources as you need.  
Open **Settings** (cog icon in the bottom-left corner), navigate to the **Data Sources** tab, and click **+ Add Data Source**.  
The process is the same as adding your first data source.

#### 3. Managing environments for a data source

Each data source can have multiple environments, which can later be switched at runtime in your built applications. This makes it possible to use different test or production data seamlessly.

To manage environments:

- Go to the **Data Sources** tab in the control panel.
- Select a data source, then open the **Environments** tab.
- **Add a new environment** by clicking **+ Add Environment**.
- **Edit** an existing environment by selecting it to open the edit form.
- **Delete** an environment by clicking **Delete Environment**.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You cannot delete the only environment of a data source.

> **Important:** The data source structure (**schema**) must be the same across all environments of a given data source. Otherwise, built applications may not work properly.

#### 4. Switching environments in built applications

When an application is running inside the builder, you can switch environments at runtime through the **Conversation Settings**. This enables quick testing across staging, development, and production environments.

## Supported Data Sources

Each data source type in **liblab.ai** may require one or more connection properties, or in some cases a slightly more complex flow (e.g., OAuth).

| Data Source   | Type                      | Required Properties / Flow | Format                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PostgreSQL    | SQL Database              | Connection URL             | `postgres(ql)://username:password@host:port/database`                                      |
| MySQL         | SQL Database              | Connection URL             | `mysql://username:password@host:port/database`                                             |
| SQLite        | SQL Database (file-based) | Connection URL             | `sqlite://path/to/database.db`                                                             |
| MongoDB       | NoSQL Database            | Connection URL             | `mongodb://username:password@host:port/database`                                           |
| Google Sheets | Spreadsheet (API)         | OAuth / Apps Script        | `sheets://SPREADSHEET_ID/` or `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID/edit` |
| HubSpot       | API                       | Access Token               | `pat-xxx-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`                                                       |

> **Note:** When adding a new data source, the connection must be valid. liblab.ai performs validation to ensure that credentials, tokens, and URLs are correct before the data source can be saved.

## Security & Best Practices

### Connection Security

#### Database Connections

```bash
# ‚úÖ Always use SSL in production
postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require

# ‚úÖ Use environment variables for credentials
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=mysql://user:${DB_PASSWORD}@host/db

# ‚ùå Never hardcode passwords
mysql://user:password123@host/db
```

#### API Authentication

```bash
# ‚úÖ Store tokens securely
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_here
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat-xxx-xxx

# ‚úÖ Use OAuth when possible
# ‚úÖ Rotate tokens regularly
# ‚úÖ Minimum required scopes only
```

### Data Protection

#### Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
- **Read-Only Access**: Use read-only database users when possible
- **Network Isolation**: Restrict database access to application servers
- **Regular Auditing**: Monitor and log data access patterns

#### Credential Management

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables
- **Encryption**: Encrypt credentials at rest
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate passwords and tokens
- **Monitoring**: Alert on unusual access patterns

### Compliance Considerations

#### Data Residency

- **Cloud Sources**: Data remains in respective cloud provider
- **Database Sources**: Data location controlled by your infrastructure
- **Local Sources**: Data remains on local systems

#### Privacy & GDPR

- **Google Workspace**: GDPR-compliant, user consent required
- **Database Sources**: Your responsibility for compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs of data access and modifications

#### Business Continuity

- **Backup Strategies**: Regular backups for critical data sources
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plan for data source unavailability
- **Monitoring**: Implement health checks and alerting
