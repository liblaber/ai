# Prompt best practices

Learn how to communicate effectively with liblab.ai to build better apps faster.

## Core principles

- Be specific. Instead of "build a dashboard," say "build a sales dashboard that shows monthly revenue, top products, and recent orders in a table."
- Give context. Tell liblab.ai what type of app you're building and who will use it.
- Start simple, then add details. Add features one at a time.
- Don't assume common sense. If something matters, include it.

## How to structure prompts

- What you want: Clear description of the feature or change
- Context: Purpose or how it fits into your app
- Requirements: Specific needs like data sources, user types, or constraints
- Examples: Sample data or similar features

## Common issues and solutions

- Missing details: Break the request into smaller parts
- Lost context: Start a new project or restate key details
- Mismatch with vision: Add specifics about appearance/behavior
- Unexpected behavior: Describe exact user flows

## Example prompts

Instead of: "Add login"

Try: "Add a login form with email and password fields. After successful login, redirect users to the main dashboard."

Instead of: "Make it look better"

Try: "Change the header background to dark blue and increase the font size of the navigation menu items."

Instead of: "Add data"

Try: "Connect the user table to show real user data with columns for name, email, and signup date."
