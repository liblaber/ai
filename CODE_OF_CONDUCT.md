# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the liblab.ai community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing AI-powered developer tools.

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

- GitHub repositories and issues
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Social media interactions when representing the project
- Conference presentations about liblab.ai

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [community@liblab.ai](mailto:community@liblab.ai). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

You can also use GitHub's Report Abuse feature for repository-related issues.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
